        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            Hi! I’m <strong>Andrew Hunter</strong>, a junior software engineer with a love for tech, music, and adventure. Here’s a little more about me.
        </p>
        
        <div class="about-section" id="technologies">
            <h2>Where it Began</h2>
            <ul>
                <p>Computers and technology have always been a huge interest of mine since a young age. What initially began with gaming,
                    especially Redstone in Minecraft, and even programming my own games on Roblox. It was never anything I thought too deeply
                    into, until I went to Junior High School and attended an afterschool programming club where we got a hold of a BBC MicroBit,
                    which was programmable with Python.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This built a strong foundation for my love of programming, and I wrote my first game fully in python.
                    Again, another break was taken from programming until I started my foundation degree and had a programming module.
                    In this we used C# with visual studio, and it was my first introduction to user interfaces outside of programming CLIs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this stage, I was never really sure about a career in programming, and kept it fully hobby-based. However, In 2023 I started
                    my bachelors degree in Computing, which offered an apprenticeship route and I secured full-time employment with Trace First - an animal
                    healthcare company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although terrifying at first, I finally got to see how a team of software engineers group together to produce superb software,
                    and was quickly introduced to Ruby on Rails and Javascript with React - and I realised that all the worrys I had before were irrelevant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although I'm at a very early stage of my career, I am so excited to see what the future beholds! 
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Other Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I don't enjoy being at my computer all day, rather, I enjoy being an avid flutist, pianist, ukulelist, and trumpeter.</li>
            </ul>
