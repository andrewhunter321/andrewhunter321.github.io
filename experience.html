        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>Here is a summary of my professional experience in software engineer, as well as healthcare:</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Junior Software Engineer at Trace First</h2>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> October 2023 – Present</p>
            <p> I develop full-stack web applications using modern technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and React. 
                I work on a range of tickets, from feature requests to bugs.
                The end users are veterinary laboratories in the USA, so a high standard of code is required. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Eden Pharmacy Portadown</h2>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> January 2020 – October 2023</p>
            <p>Working as a pharmacy assistant, I provided assistance to a team of pharmacists, as well as helping customers.
                On the weekends, I delivered prescriptions to those who were unable to leave their house. I also developed
                a stock system on my lunch breaks to control the movement of drugs throughout different branches of the pharmacy,
                which included a live reporting system so all branches were aware of existing stocks.
