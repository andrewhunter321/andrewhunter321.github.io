        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Programming is also my hobby. Sometimes, I think of random things that would be a good challenge. Here they are:</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Noise2Notes</h2>
            <p>Stack: Python CLI</p>
            <p>Using Google Colab, I utilized the Aubio, music21, and SoundFile libraries to convert an MP3 file to MIDI.
                The MIDI file could then be mapped to a pitch and could identify the notes being played. 
                It is capable of accurately converting piano and flute notes to alphabetical characters.</p>
            <p>The idea for this came from my relative pitch skills. It was a struggle to share my musical ideas with others.
                Unfortunately, this project is not hosted anywhere.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Snake Game</h2>
            <p>Stack: Dart on Flutter, with an Ubuntu database server and PHP</p>
            <p>I created this as part of a Mobile App and Cloud assignment for my Computing degree. 
                Again, this isn't hosted anywhere, but you can see the screenshots below:</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Floor Plan Modeller</h2>
            <p>Stack: JavaScript</p>
            <p>During the summer, I wanted to build a shed. Frustrated with available floor plan modeling software, 
                I decided to build my own. I'm still working on it, and the final goal is to integrate AI for converting the 
                birdâ€™s eye view into a 3D model.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h2>Ulster Fades</h2>
            <p>Stack: Ruby on Rails</p>
            <p>A friend of mine, a barber, was frustrated with subscription costs for booking software. I built him a personal website, 
                allowing him to focus on barbering while I handle the technical aspects.</p>
