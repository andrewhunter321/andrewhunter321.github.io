        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Programming is also my hobby. Sometimes, I think of random things that would be a good challenge. Here is my progression of projects from first to last:</p>

                <h2>Noise2Notes</h2>
                <p><strong>Stack:</strong> Python CLI</p>
                <p>Using Google Colab, I utilized the Aubio, music21, and SoundFile libraries to convert an MP3 file to a MIDI output - which was then converted to notes.
                    The origins came from my skill of relative pitch, and it was often a struggle to share my musical ideas to those who
                    were less musically gifted. The main purpose of this is often I don't play music as it is written, and improvise instead.
                    Instead of trying to remember what I'm playing, I thought it would be a better idea to record myself and have the next stage
                    of music sharing done automatically.

                <h2>Snake Game</h2>
                <p><strong>Stack:</strong> Dart on Flutter, with an Ubuntu database server and PHP</p>
                <p>I created this as part of a Mobile App and Cloud assignment for my Computing degree. It used Dart with Flutter for the front end,
                    and PHP for the backend APIs to save the users score and authentication credentials. Alonside this, I created HTML pages
                    alongisde PHPMyAdmin, to add levels of user restriction to allow easier development of the backend. At some stage, I would love to
                    have this available as a downloadable Android APK.

                <h2>Floor Plan Modeller</h2>
                <p><strong>Stack:</strong> JavaScript</p>
                <p>During the summer, I wanted to build a shed. Frustrated with available floor plan modeling software, I decided to build my own. This was done
                    fully in Javascript. The end goal of this is to integrate OpenAI to convert the 2D model into a 3D one.

                <h2>Ulster Fades</h2>
                <p><strong>Stack:</strong> Ruby on Rails with Javascript and an S3 Bucket</p>
                <p>A friend of mine, a barber, was frustrated with subscription costs for booking software. I saw this as an oportunity to develop
                    my skills in Ruby on Rails, and shortly after I had a very happy friend. I used Render to host this, alongside their
                    cloud database capabilities. To keep costs low, I crafted everything from scratch. This will be developed long-term, recently
                    I weaved JavaScript throughout it, and added AWS integration for an S3 bucket.

                <p><strong>Stack:</strong> HTML, JavaScript, and CSS - hosted on Github Pages</p>
                <p>I thought it was finally time to create a static site for me to keep track of what stage of my career I am at.
                    I also wanted a space to showcase what I'm developing. My solution was this site. I'll continue to keep this space
                    up to date, and use it as a space to develop my skills on the front end.
